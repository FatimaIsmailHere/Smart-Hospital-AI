ðŸ“– Project Description
Smart Hospital AI is a 4-in-1 hospital intelligence dashboard that supports doctors,
nurses, and administrators with predictive insights and recommendations.

ðŸ”„ Workflow:
Data Input â€“ Patient data is entered into the system.
Risk Prediction â€“ An XGBoost model classifies patients into High, Medium, or Low risk.
Case Retrieval â€“ SentenceTransformers + TiDB Vector Search fetch similar past patient cases.
AI Recommendations â€“ An LLM generates actionable suggestions based on predictions and retrieved cases.
Insights Dashboard â€“ Dash + Plotly visualize hospital-wide patterns, including ER surge simulations and resource allocation advice.

âœ¨ Key Features:
Prediction Result â€“ Patient risk classification.
Similar Patient Cases â€“ Evidence-based context retrieval.
AI Recommendations â€“ Staff/treatment guidance.
Hospital Insights â€“ Aggregated metrics and surge simulations.

By combining prediction, retrieval, recommendations, and insights into a seamless workflow,
Smart Hospital AI transforms raw hospital data into a real-time decision-support system, enabling 
better patient care, optimized resources, and proactive crisis management.
